This webscraper was built to collect information about untested but possible cases of Covid-19 infections in Bangladesh. The country was hit hard with the deadly virus infection. However, there were reports of infection cases outside the official count. This webscraper can collect news articles from the popular local news site <a href="https://bdnews24.com/">bdnews24.com</a> about possible news of Covid-19 infections and deaths, and compile it into a single file.
